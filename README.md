# 3chipphone
a cheap 3d and 2d printed phone

#
it is  for doing a cheap 2d and 3d printed phone
#
this is the basic capabilities
and branches for evolved versions
#
you can check it take it and print it to use it 
#

cheap and ease of use  
to be a print and use  



#
you can suggest your modules and things if you want the phone to be 
as long as you do it for the phone and its users 
and dont take it personnal 



check the issues
the way is cheap and easy to use

you can check the github how to 


#
the basic scheme is 
3 chip
send only
antenna
get only
 
 

the chip for the antenna is the big chip  
the send only chip means that it takes datas and send it to the antenna chip  
the get only chip means that it gets datas of the antenna chip and use it  

all has to be done cheap  
cheapness and ease of use  
 
#  
send  
capsule gets waves datas  
sends it to the chip for crypto  
by a send only  
it can pass by a direct real crypto on its way  
  to the antenna chip  
  which gets it  
  and processes it  
  send it to the antenna  
  
get  
  gets back datas by antenna  
  send it to the antenna chip  
send it by the get only  
can pass by a direct real crypto on its way  
to the chip for crypto  
that sends it to the capsule for waves  
     
   #  
   all needs to be done  
     
   cheaper  
   may mean redoing the processes  
       
   ease of use   
   may mean print all  
   
   
   capsule   
   crypto chip  
   antenna chip  
   send only   
   get only  
      
       
    #  
   it might need a printer that can print all  
   capsules  
   chips  
   lasers   
   battery  
   dissolvable   
   
   it would be 6 extruders or a way to use it  
   
   
   #  
   scalable   
   cheap   
   upgradable   
   re engineerable   
   useable

   the licences will be the licence of the modules
